### Project Overview

 Contains a set of mini programming challenges in python.  The project has been solved using only python programming without using advanced scientific packages such as numpy , pandas etc.

Following are the set of programs in the mini challenge:

    **Palindrome :**  Palindrome are the strings which reads the same both backwards and forward. The target is to find the palindrome number which comes next to the number entered

    **Scramble :**  In general terms we refer scramble as Jumbled words. The Target is to find whether a given string can be formed from another string. 

    **Fibonacci :** It is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. In the project the target is to find wether the provided number is a Fibonacci number.

    **Compress :** The target of the project is to identify the sequence of character in a string with the number of their occurances in order of their occurance in the string. As for example : "sab" would give 's1a1b1'

    **Distinct Words:**  The target is to identify the number of distinct charcters in a string.
